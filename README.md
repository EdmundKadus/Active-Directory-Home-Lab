# Active-Directory VM Lab
## Overview 
<div>

This is a VM-based home lab I have built to mimic (as accurately as possible) a corporate Active Directory (AD) system. I have only touched on AD at a surface level during my internship as an End User Computing (EUC) support. This project will allow me to take a further dive into AD and serve as prerequisite knowledge to aid in my offensive security journey.
